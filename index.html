	<h1>Oh boy, you're here. I'm sorry.</h1>

	<p>The is my Island of Misfit Projects--a final resting place for all the little things I've made that are either too boring to host independently or were abandonded before completion.</p>

	<h2>Links:</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>
			<a href='tech-doc/index.html'><h3>Tech Docs</h3></a>
			<p>A technical documentation site with little to offer besides dark mode.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href='bubblegum/index.html'><h3>Bubblegum AI</h3></a>
			<p>Don't be deceived by the navigation links, this product landing page has no contact form. Perfect for the failing business!</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href='count-my-beans/index.html'><h3>Count My Beans</h3></a>
			<p>A coffee calculator for the perfect brew. This thing actually works, it's just so ugly I can't stand to use it.</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href='elephant/index.html'><h3>Elephant</h3></a>
			<p>This "material design" calculator records your calculations and shows them in a list. Did I mention that it rounds to the nearest 100,000,000th?</p>
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href='timer/index.html'><h3>Pushover Timer</h3></a>
			<p>This pomodoro timer lives by no rules. Add or subtract the remaining time whenever you'd like, it doesn't care. If you are into time-<i>mis</i>management, this is for you.</p>

		</li>

		<li>
			<a href='letter-pool/index.html'><h3>Letter Pool</h3></a>
			<p>Good luck with this one. The idea was to allow a user to submit any array of letters, then indicate which letters remain as the user creates new phrases from the letter pool. Just don't type anything too quickly!</p>
